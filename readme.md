# FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects

This repository was created to showcase the final projects I developed during the **Responsive Web Design** course from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

Each project here was built independently, applying the concepts learned throughout the course without the use of step-by-step tutorials. Itâ€™s a way to consolidate my learning, exercise creativity, and demonstrate my web development skills.

## Projects
The projects were designed to meet the course requirements but with personalized touches to reflect my style and understanding of the concepts. Check out each one in the folders of this repository!

1. **Survey Form** - A responsive and well-structured form built to practice creating and styling forms for user interaction.
<!-- 2. **Project Name 2** - Brief description of the project.
3. **Project Name 3** - Brief description of the project.
4. **Final Project** - My biggest challenge in the module, where I brought everything I learned together. -->

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Content structure.
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design.
- **Responsiveness**: Focus on layouts that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.

## About Me
I am a **Software Engineering** student with a passion for continuous learning in technology. This repository is part of my portfolio, where I share projects that showcase my growth and commitment to web development.
